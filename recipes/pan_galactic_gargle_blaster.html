            <h1>Enjoy having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon, wrapped 'round a large gold brick!</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h3><p>The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster was invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox, a major character in Douglas Adams' novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is described as "like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon, wrapped 'round a large gold brick." It has also been described in the novel as "the alcoholic equivalent to a mugging; expensive and bad for the head."</p></h3>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
                <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V (Oh, that Santragian seawater! Oh, those Santragian fish!)</li>
                <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).</li>
                <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
                <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heavy odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet, and mystic.</li>
                <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
                <li>Add an olive.</li>
                <li>Drink . . . but . . . very carefully . . .</li>
            </ol>
